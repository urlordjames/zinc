# zinc
The open source release of my toy programming language called zinc.  Features safe interpreted execution, JIT execution, and compilation using the system linker.

Entirely distinct from https://github.com/zinc-lang/zinc, I started working on this project in a private git repo before it was published on GitHub (initial commit on 4-21-22).  Try their language, it's probably better than what you'll find here.
